# chip-8-interpreter
this is my chip-8 interpreter written in C (i may call it an emulator at times in the source code. this is not entirely true.)

to use the makefile, rename it to 'makefile' (do not leave it as makefile_template) and change the INCLUDE and LIBRARY variables to contain the paths to your SDL3 \include and \library paths.

i wrote this for Windows, so you may have to replace 'SDL3.dll' with something more compatible with your device if you are not also on Windows.

to get SDL3, go to the 'releases' section of https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL, then download and extract an SDL3 release. this should also provide you with the necessary \include and \library directories and files for the makefile.

thank you for checking out this project, and enjoy (:
